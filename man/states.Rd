\description{
Dataframe showing the transitivity and intransitivity of each
of the four triads, the number of nodes,
the number of edges, the number of other individuals dominated
by the top-ranked individual, the mean distance of the network
and the maximum difference between out-degree and in-degrees,
in a four node network. Also gives the class of each state.
